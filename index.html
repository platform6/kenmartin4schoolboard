      <h2 id="top">Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Ken Martin and I am running for a position on the Merrimack School Board.  My family and I moved to Merrimack in 2017 and we are here to stay.</p>
        <p>I am the parent of a 1st grader at Mastricola Elementary School on top of being a taxpayer and resident of our great town.</p>
        <p>I am currently the Director of Instrumental Music at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, NH and have been for the past 6 years.</p>
        <p>Prior to Winnacunnet High School, I taught elementary and middle school band and general music classes in the Goffstown School District for 9 years.
         I have been actively involved in public schools in New Hampshire in some aspect since I was 5 years old, whether as a student, educator or parent.</p>
        <p>As a member of the executive board for the New Hampshire Music Educators Association I have served on a number of educational
         committees and task forces for the New Hampshire Music Educators Association as well as the New Hampshire Department of Education.</p>
        <p>There is no better reflection of the success of a community than it’s public schools.  Beyond being a source of rigorous curriculum as well as providing developmentally
         appropriate social-emotional learning, our schools should also be a source of inspiration.</p>
        <p>Students are challenged every day and our schools need to be ready for when those
         challenges arise. Schools need to be a safe, inclusive environment where all students and their families feel valued and appreciated.
         Our diversity makes us stronger and should be celebrated.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients for Sucess</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Educators</h3></li>
          <p>Two ingredients are needed in order for schools to be successful and we are very lucky that we already benefit from an abundance of riches with the first, which is educators.
          Our devoted, creative and talented educators in Merrimack have experienced a professional shift unlike any other this past year.  They have been beacons of strength and professionalism
          throughout.</p>
          <p>They deserve our respect, energy and support to ensure that they have the resources they need to continue the high level of educational standards that have been set.
          They must also uphold their end of the bargain and remain vigilant to their craft.  Keeping up with the latest educational technology and practices is essential for our students
          to be ready for the real world in the 21st century.</p>
        <li><h3>Community Buy-In</h3></li>
          <p>The second ingredient is 100% buy-in from our community.  A school’s success is a direct result of the community that supports it.  Concerts, art exhibits, sports and academic showcases
          can be life changing moments in a child’s life and our community needs to be there to support those moments, both physically and emotionally.</p>
          Community participation in schools needs to be encouraged. Whether it’s chaperoning a field trip, joining a booster club or volunteering to help in the library,  community members should
          be encouraged to take an active role in the educational community.</p>
        </ul>
      <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-7x"></i>
      <h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
          <p>While I am an optimist by nature, it’s important to keep a focus on the financial realities that we face as a community.  The past year has been a challenge for everyone for a number of
          different reasons and we are all feeling those challenges in our check books.</p>
          <p>It is our duty to make sure our schools are financially supported and that those tax dollars are put to good,
          appropriate uses.  Growing up in the Manchester School District, I remember the paper shortages and lack of textbooks that we were forced to endure due to lack of funds.  And yet our
          teachers made our schools flourish and a place I wanted to be despite those financial challenges.  When you have great teachers, money isn’t everything.  But it can make things easier
          in a number of ways.</p>
          <p>I have been in schools with massive budgets and never ending resources.  I have been in schools with little to no financial or community support.
            My experiences provide me with valuable insights into what makes a school successful and adversely, less than successful.  I ask for your trust and the opportunity to make positive
            change in the education of our most important community asset, our children.</p>
        <i class="fas fa-user-graduate fa-7x"></i>
      <h2>Outcome Flexibility</h2>
        <p>Schools need to provide paths and opportunities for students to discover their passions and encourage them to explore those passions.  There is not a “one size fits all” educational model
           that works for all students and families.  Schools should be flexible and explore educational avenues for those students who might thrive under alternative education assignments.</p>
        <p>While college remains an appropriate and attainable option for many families after high school, it is imperative to recognize this path is not for everyone.
           Trade schools, the armed services, and the workforce remain as important today as they have ever been and we need to ensure that those students are also well equipped with the skills
           they need to walk down those paths.</p>
