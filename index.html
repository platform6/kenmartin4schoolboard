       <h1>Ken Martin</h1>
        <p>If elected, my focus will center around the following:<p>
          <ul>
            <li>Work with teachers and administrators to close the educational gaps created by the pandemic.</li>
            <li>Support the Merrimack School District and teacher’s association to become one of the most desirable and competitive school districts in the state to work for.</li>
            <li>Create a 21st century learning environment that provides tools for every student to be successful in the real world.</li>
            <li>Address our student retention rate and find where the disconnect occurs.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Manchester, NH my family and I moved to Merrimack in 2017 and we are thrilled to be establishing roots here.</p>
        <p>On top of being a taxpayer and resident of our great town, I am also the parent of a 2nd grader at Mastricola Elementary School. For the past seven years, 
          I have been the Director of Instrumental Music at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, NH. I previously taught elementary and middle school band and general 
          music classes in the Goffstown School District for 9 years</p>
        <p>As a lifelong NH resident, I have been actively involved in our public schools in some aspect since I was 5 years old, as a student, educator and now parent.
           I served on the executive board for the New Hampshire Music Educators Association (NHMEA) for 10 years and have been a part of multiple educational committees 
           and task forces for the NHMEA as well as the New Hampshire Department of Education.</p>
        <p>There is no better reflection of the success of a community than its public schools.</p>
        <p>Beyond being a source of rigorous curriculum and providing developmentally appropriate social-emotional
          learning, our schools should also be a source of inspiration. Students are challenged every day and our
          schools need to be ready for when those challenges arise. Schools need to be a safe, inclusive environment
          where all students and their families feel valued and appreciated. Our diversity makes us stronger and should be celebrated.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients for Success</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Two ingredients are needed in order for schools to be successful and we
        are very lucky that we already benefit from an abundance of riches with the first.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Educators</h3></li>
          <p>Our devoted, creative and talented educators in Merrimack have experienced
            a professional shift unlike any other this past year. They have been
            beacons of strength and professionalism throughout. They deserve our respect,
            energy and support to ensure that they have the resources they need to continue
            the high level of educational standards that have been set. They must
            also uphold their end of the bargain and remain vigilant to their craft.
            Keeping up with the latest educational technology and practices is essential
            for our students to be ready for the real world in the 21st century.</p>
        <li><h3>Community Buy-In</h3></li>
          <p>The second ingredient is 100% buy-in from our community. A school’s success is a direct result of the
             community that supports it. Concerts, art exhibits, sports and academic showcases can be life changing moments in a
             child’s life and our community needs to be there to support those moments, both physically and emotionally. Community participation
             in schools needs to be encouraged. Whether it’s chaperoning a field trip, joining a booster club or volunteering to help in the library,
             community members should be encouraged to take an active role in the educational community.</p>
        </ul>

      <div class="full-screen-flex-section">
        <div class="center">
      <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-7x" ></i>
          <h2>Budget Considerations</h2>
          </div>
          <p>While I am an optimist by nature, it’s important to keep a focus on the financial realities that we face as a community.
            The past year has been a challenge for everyone for a number of different reasons and we are all feeling those challenges in our check books.</p>
            <p>It is our duty to make sure our schools are financially supported and that those tax dollars are put to good, appropriate uses.
            I remember the paper shortages and lack of textbooks that we were forced to endure due to lack of funds during my student years in the Manchester School District.
            Despite the financial challenges, my teachers made our schools flourish and a place I wanted to be. When you have great teachers, money isn’t everything.
            But it can make things easier in a number of ways.
          </p>

        <i class="fas fa-user-graduate fa-7x"></i>
      <h2>Outcome Flexibility</h2>
      </div>
        <p>Schools need to provide paths and opportunities for students to discover
          their passions and encourage them to explore those passions. There is not a “one size fits all”
          educational model that works for all students and families. Schools need to be flexible and
          explore educational avenues for those students who might thrive under alternative education assignments.</p>
          <p>While college remains an appropriate and attainable option for many families after high school,
          it is imperative to recognize this path is not for everyone. Trade schools, the armed services,
          and the workforce remain as important today as they have ever been and we need to ensure that those students
          are also well equipped with the skills they need to walk down those paths.</p>

        <p>I have been in schools with massive budgets and never ending resources. I have been in schools without financial or community support.
           These experiences provide me with valuable insights into not only what makes a school successful, but also to assess what things aren't working.</p>
        <p>I ask for your trust and the opportunity to make positive change in the education of our most important community asset, the children of Merrimack.</p>

  <h1>Naomi Halter</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a parent with two children in Merrimack Schools: a kindergartener at Thornton’s Ferry and a 5th grader at the upper elementary. 
      Our family has called Merrimack home for almost 15 years, we love the community here! Especially the parks and walking on the trails with our dog, Ike. 
      The kids have been involved with MYA soccer and baseball, attended preschool at the YMCA, and we’re just starting to get into Girl Scouts.</p>
    <p>Professionally my career has been in business and non-profit sectors, first managing the events department at Business NH Magazine, and then directing volunteer 
      operations for NH Granite State Ambassadors (NHGSA). At Business NH Magazine I ran the highly successful Made In NH Expo, plus their other annual events, and was 
      responsible for generating more than 25% of their annual gross revenue. At Granite State Ambassadors I coordinated training, communication, and events between their
       300+ volunteers and many member volunteer centers. NHGSA is a volunteer organization that supports tourism in NH, the state’s second largest industry. </p>
    <p>Between those positions, when my son was young, I even spent a few years driving school buses in Merrimack! Recently I’ve been substitute teaching, which has been 
      wonderful, challenging, and incredibly eye-opening. Our educators work so hard, and care so deeply about our schools and kids.</p>
    <p>Since 2016 I’ve served on the NH Board of Trustees for the Eastern States Exposition (Big E), and have recently been nominated to chair the Promotions Committee, 
      which is responsible for bringing awareness to the organization and its mission to folks in NH. This year I’m the Cookie Mom for my daughter’s Girl Scout troop, 
      which has been tons of fun! I also volunteer with the Granite State Ambassadors.</p>
      <h2>Why I’m Running for School Board</h2>
    <p>I’m running for School Board because I care passionately about our schools and our community, and making sure our schools remain welcoming spaces that provide 
      quality educational opportunities for all children. My unique background, especially the organizational and communication skills, will be of great benefit to the 
      Board.</p>
      <p>Community is a huge priority for me. A strong sense of community is vital for student success, teacher retention, and parent satisfaction. I am most looking 
        forward to connecting with all members of our community, to hear your concerns and aspirations for our schools!</p>
    <h2>My Priorities</h2>
    <h3>Set students up for success</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Our students need to be supported as we come out of the pandemic and offered whatever assistance necessary to fill knowledge gaps and transition successfully 
        to a more “normal” learning environment</li>
      <li>We need to look at our dropout rate in Merrimack, and identify and address issues that lead to dropping out, in the lower grades</li>
      <li>Our reading instruction in the elementary schools needs to be examined. Some of that work is underway already, and it’s vital that it continue, so our students have a strong foundation in literacy.</li>
      <li>The successful student should be defined by the student and their families: college preparation, military service, and entering the trades are all desirable outcomes for our graduates and all should be supported.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Be A Place Where Good Teachers Want to Work</h2>
  </div>
  <p>We need to bring our compensation and benefits package to a level that’s competitive with other local districts, so we can attract and retain the best teachers</p>
  <p>Make sure our superintendent and administrative staff are fostering a community/work environment where people want to be.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="full-screen-flex-section">
    <div class="center">
      <i class="fas fa-solid fa-comments fa-7x"></i>
      <h2>Communicate With Parents and The Community</h2>
      </div>
      <p>I am committed to being responsive to parent and constituent concerns, while knowing that some of these communications are subject to state law.
         If for some reason I can’t address a specific concern, you can count on me to explain why.</p>
        <p>I am always happy to take time to explain how and why decisions are reached.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="full-screen-flex-section">
      <div class="center">
        <i class="fas fa-solid fa-hammer fa-7x"></i>
  <h2>Facilities Planning</h2>
  </div>
    <p>Merrimack has some unique challenges with its facilities, with multiple buildings ranging in age from 18 to 60 years old. Our facilities planning 
      needs to be well researched, organized, and consistent, with funding planned well in advance in order to be transparent to taxpayers.</p>
