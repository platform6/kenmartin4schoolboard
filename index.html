      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>My name is Ken Martin and I am running for a position on the Merrimack School Board.  My family and I moved to Merrimack in 2017 and we are here to stay.</p>
      <p>I am the parent of a 1st grader at Mastricola Elementary School on top of being a taxpayer and resident of our great town.  I am currently the Director of Instrumental
         Music at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, NH and have been for the past 6 years.  Prior to Winnacunnet High School, I taught elementary and middle school band and
         general music classes in the Goffstown School District for 9 years.  I have been actively involved in public schools in New Hampshire in some aspect since I was 5 years old,
         whether as a student, educator or parent.  I currently serve on the executive board for the New Hampshire Music Educators Association and have served on a number of educational
         committees and task forces for the New Hampshire Music Educators Association as well as the New Hampshire Department of Education.</p>
      <p>There is no better reflection of the success of a community than itâ€™s public schools.  Beyond being a source of rigorous curriculum as well as providing developmentally
         appropriate social-emotional learning, our schools should also be a source of inspiration.  Students are challenged every day and our schools need to be ready for when those
         challenges arise. Schools need to be a safe, inclusive environment where all students and their families feel valued and appreciated.
         Our diversity makes us stronger and should be celebrated.</p>
      <p>Two ingredients are needed in order for schools to be successful and we are very lucky that we already benefit from an abundance of riches with the first, which is educators.
         Our devoted, creative and talented educators in Merrimack have experienced a professional shift unlike any other this past year.  They have been beacons of strength and professionalism
         throughout.  They deserve our respect, energy and support to ensure that they have the resources they need to continue the high level of educational standards that have been set.
         They must also uphold their end of the bargain and remain vigilant to their craft.  Keeping up with the latest educational technology and practices is essential for our students
         to be ready for the real world in the 21st century.</p>
